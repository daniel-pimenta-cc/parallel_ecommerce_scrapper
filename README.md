# Magento2 to WooCommerce Scraper

This web scraping project was developed to address the specific requirements of a freelance project. The task involved extracting information from an e-commerce website built on Magento 2 and transferring it to a WordPress site powered by WooCommerce. While some aspects of this scraper are tailored to the target website, this repository serves as a valuable starting point for anyone looking to build a web scraper with parallel processing capabilities.

## Project Background

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracting comprehensive product information, including product names, links, and additional data from a Magento based e-commerce website.
2. **Data Transformation**: Transforming the extracted data into a suitable format for importing it into a WordPress site running WooCommerce.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Implementing parallelism to expedite the data extraction process, making it more efficient and faster.

## Key Features

- **Scraping Categories**: The scraper can extract data from specific product categories on a Magento 2 site.
